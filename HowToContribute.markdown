## Development Process ##

Development of the plugin is managed on our [github repository](https://github.com/gluster/hadoop-glusterfs). The gluster forge repository is a read-only mirror of the github repository. We enthusiastically welcome any pull requests on our github repository. 

Prior to submitting a pull request, please ensure [that you are able to build the plugin](https://forge.gluster.org/hadoop/pages/HowToBuild) with your changes and that all the build tests pass. If you have additional questions, please use the gluster mailing list that is listed on the project page.
